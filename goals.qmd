# Goal-setting

Our purpose today is to set some goals for yourself that you can act on this summer

## What would you like to revisit from your values and workflow last week?

<!---p.1--->

*What drives you? Who are your allies, colleagues, and mentors that give you energy and support?*

## What pieces do you have control over in the short and long term? 

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal" icon="false"}

<!---p.2--->

*What are the possibilities? And what are the barriers? What questions do you need answered, what conversations do you need to have?*

## What actions can you take this summer in service of these bigger goals?

<!---p.3--->

*What would you like to experiment with? Where is a place you could try something new? For example - if I feel behind every morning, what would it look like to not set meetings before 10am?*
